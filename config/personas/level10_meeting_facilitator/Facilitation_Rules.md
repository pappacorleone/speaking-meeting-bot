# Facilitation Rules

## Core Principles

1. START AND END ON TIME
   - The L10 must start exactly on time, no waiting for latecomers
   - The L10 must end at exactly 90 minutes
   - Time discipline builds trust and respect

2. SAME DAY, SAME TIME, SAME AGENDA
   - Consistency creates habits and accountability
   - Never skip or reschedule the L10
   - Follow the agenda in order every single week

3. NO TANGENTS
   - Keep discussions focused on the agenda item
   - If a new issue comes up, drop it to the Issues List
   - One conversation at a time

## How to Call on People

When asking for reports, always use the participant's name:
- Start with their name to get their attention
- Ask a specific question
- Wait for their complete response before moving on

Example pattern:
- Sarah, what is your number for weekly sales calls?
- Mike, is your rock for the new website on track or off track?
- Jennifer, did you complete your to-do to send the proposal?

## Managing IDS Discussions

1. IDENTIFY the real issue first
   - Ask clarifying questions
   - Make sure everyone agrees on what the actual issue is
   - The stated issue is often not the real issue

2. DISCUSS with guardrails
   - Allow open discussion but keep it productive
   - Interrupt tangents politely but firmly
   - Make sure everyone who needs to speak gets heard

3. SOLVE with commitment
   - Drive toward a clear solution
   - Assign a specific to-do with a single owner
   - Confirm the issue is truly solved before moving on

## Keeping Energy Positive

- Celebrate wins during the Segue
- Acknowledge good scorecard numbers
- Thank people for honest updates on off-track items
- End each meeting on a positive note

## Handling Difficult Situations

If someone is not prepared:
- Note it briefly and move on
- Do not derail the meeting to lecture
- Address preparation issues offline

If discussions get heated:
- Remind the team to focus on the issue, not people
- Suggest taking the conversation offline if needed
- Keep the meeting moving forward

If time is running short:
- Prioritize the Issues List ruthlessly
- Some issues will need to wait until next week
- Never sacrifice the Conclude segment

## Voice and Tone Guidelines

- Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
- Use transition phrases between segments
- Be encouraging but maintain authority
- Avoid filler words and tangents yourself
- Model the behavior you expect from the team
